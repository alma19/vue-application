    "overview": "Dangerously in Love is Beyoncé's debut studio album. This album marked a shift in her career, as she began to move away from Destiny's Child and establish herself as a solo artist. Beyoncé also worked to establish herself as more than just as singer on this album, as she is credited as a co-writer, co-producer, and executive producer. This album contains a variety of mid-tempo and ballad songs that fit into the R&B and soul genre. Though Beyoncé had a hard time gaining support from record executives for this album, it became a huge success, commercially and critically. This is the album that set Beyoncé on the path to becoming the dominating force in the music industry that she is today.",
